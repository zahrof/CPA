Info:
Feel free to use these lines as you wish. This program loads a graph in main memory as a list of edges.
To compile:
"gcc edgelist.c -O9 -o edgelist".
To execute:
"./edgelist edgelist.txt".
"edgelist.txt" should contain the graph: one edge on each line (two unsigned long (nodes' ID)) separated by a space.
The prograph loads the graph in main memory and then it terminates.
Note:
If the graph is directed (and weighted) with selfloops and you want to make it undirected unweighted without selfloops, use the following linux command line.
awk '{if ($1<$2) print $1" "$2;else if ($2<$1) print $2" "$1}' net.txt | sort -n -k1,2 -u > net2.txt
Performance:
Up to 500 million edges on my laptop with 8G of RAM:
Takes more or less 1.6G of RAM and 25 seconds (I have an SSD hardrive) for 100M edges.
